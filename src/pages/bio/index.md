    Artist Statement: I strive to reopen art accessibility through precise, conceptual intention. My intent is mastering the blend of art history and contemporary cultural influence into creative & empathic artwork. Bound to no medium, I pursue connectivity in belief to create art bigger than Art itself. As each artwork relates to space, my importance is creating through lived experience and I establish it from a place of service.
