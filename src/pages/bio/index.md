**Artist Statement:** I strive to open art accessibility through precise, conceptual intention. My intent is mastering the blend of art history and contemporary cultural influence into creative & empathic artwork. Bound to no medium, I pursue connectivity in the belief of creating art bigger than Art itself. As each piece relates to space, my importance is creating through lived experience and I establish it from a place of service.
